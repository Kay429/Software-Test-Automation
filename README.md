How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

* Mistakes happen. They will always find ways into my code, so the best way to ensure my work is functional and secure is with frequent, thorough testing. Tests can help me to refine my code and to verify that it works as intended.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

* User needs are often fairly vague, like "the user needs to log in using a username and password" or "the website must keep data secure". These needs can be refined into requirements, which are specific things the program needs to do or qualities it needs to have. For example, "the program will notify the user if an incorrect password was entered" or "user data will be encrypted" are requirements. For my assignments, I usually keep a list of requirements that I use to plan, code, and test my program. Once I feel like my work is done, I walk through the entire requirements list to ensure I have successfully met every one.

How do I approach designing software?

 * I always use the requirements as the basis of my designs. I begin with a list of requirements and then create a base plan for how I am going to meet them all. This plan can range from a couple sentences describing a class to diagrams scrawled on paper; what matters is that I end up with a basic idea of what I am going to create. Many assignments are simple enough that I can start coding from there, but if I am truly designing software from scratch, I will need to write a lot of pseudocode and draw some more diagrams before I write any code. Through the whole process, my requirements are my rock. I continuously refer to them and use them to guide my work. This helps me keep focus on the core pupose of my program, even if I get sidetracked.
